The fortune teller predicts that their luck will change dramatically overnight, and it is up to them to make the best or worst of it. On the same day, a stranger, Arjunan, arrives and asks if he can stay for the night. While initially reluctant, they take him in, and increasingly become comfortable with him. Arjunan gets to know about the financial issues that the family is having. He shows them a box full of money and jewels and says that his luck changed by working hard, assuring them that so could theirs. Mallika, enchanted by the riches and his good looks, tries to seduce Arjunan, before he chastises her for trying to do so. Mallika later talks her parents into killing Arjunan and stealing the gold and cash to solve their problems. Even though the parents are hesitant, they agree to the plan. After a couple of hiccups, including a plan to poison Arjunan which goes awry, Mallika kills Arjunan by cutting his throat while he is sleeping. Meanwhile, Karuppusamy gets excessively drunk at the local liquor shop, and the sympathetic bar boy tells him to go home by revealing something about Arjunan in his house. Karuppusamy is stunned by the revelation and comes home as fast as he can to tell the family the truth. Realizing that he has been murdered, he laments that Arjunan was none other than their long-lost son Karunakaran, who had run away when he was 10 years old. He had come back to visit his family, after working hard to earn money and settling himself. The family is devastated. They all consume the poison intended for Karunakaran, and Karuppusamy uses all the cotton in the house to set it on fire and burns himself along with it. An in-credits voiceover shows the diary entry Karunakaran wrote before he slept, where he decides to leave the money and jewels at the house and leave it as a stranger before the morning. He originally plots a prank to not reveal his identity just for a day, but since his sister had, out of her necessity, tried to seduce him, he changes his mind to save his sister from forever being in disgust of her actions.",John Mahendran(dialogues),Sam C.

There she comes across an ancient book named 'Karungaapiyam'. The book contains a bunch of short stories filled with supernatural elements. Though the book looks old and seems to have been written decades ago, most of its stories take place in the present and involve elements like the lockdown, technological developments etc., making Umayaal wonder about the author's ability to see the future. When she couldn't find the author's name, she calls Priya to check the author from the library's catalogue and continues to read the book. As she reads, she starts experiencing strange happenings around her and sees ghosts from those stories. But she continues to read on. The fourth story is about Karthika who lived during the British rule in India, in a secluded village in Tamil Nadu where she was respected and revered for her kind and generous heart. The villagers also believed she had the blessings of God and that whatever she writes down came true. Suddenly, mysterious murders start occurring in the village and children go missing. Karthika's husband who was serving in the military suddenly dies leaving her behind with their daughter, Umayaal (the same name as the heroine) and his brother. Thereafter, word spreads that she is a witch responsible for all the murders and missing cases in their village. The entire community begins to treat her poorly, and she is forced to relocate to the village's outskirts. But the actual bad guy behind all those murders is Karthika's husband's greedy brother who plans to pin all the blame on Karthika to eliminate her, wanting all their wealth for himself. The villagers, except for a few, fall for this and stone the innocent Karthika to death. She comes back as a ghost and kills the villain and his men when they plan to eliminate kathika's daughter Umayaal just as they did Karthika. The story ends here. Umayaal finishes reading the story and runs out of the library when the paranormal stuff starts again. She gets home and shares all she experienced that day with Priya who tells her that the name of the author of 'karungaapiyam' is Umayaal karthika which also happens to be the full name of our heroine, umayaal. This shocks them and they feel there is a connection between the author and our heroine. Priya says that Karthika must've foreseen her own ending too and thus has written this book. She adds that Umayaal is the reincarnation of Karthika and might possess superpowers just like Karthika. To test her theory, she asks Umayaal to write something. Umayaal initially writes some silly stuff, then writes that the murderer is Santa Claus with an axe and a bell chases her. When nothing happens, they laugh and the friend leaves to go home.

Saba pleads to get released, but the sub-inspector lets the other guy out after hearing his love-failure story. So Saba tries to narrate his love story in order to get out of the police jeep. Saba shares his school love story, (In 2008 - Erode) where he studied eleventh grade and had a crush on Eesha. He tries to convey his love to her, but he can't do it, as every single attempt he makes ends in failure. He gets disappointed when he finds out from his friends that she is in love with Ashwin, a twelfth-grade school senior. Later, his friends tell him that she is not in love with Ashwin, and she just talks with him casually due to her cousin's sister's request.In 2009On the farewell day of school, Saba hoped to convey his love to her, but he didn't because of his friend SS. Karthik gets heartbroken after Gayathri rejects his proposal. So Saba goes with SS Karthik in order to make his friend feel better. That's the last day he met her, and he didn't even speak with her during his school days. Later, he joins an engineering college in Coimbatore, where he meets Riya, and they eventually fall in love. After some moments, he introduced her to his friend Gokul in the hope that he could pass messages easily through him to her as Gokul was studying in the same department as her. But Gokul and Riya fell in love, so Saba became single again.In ChennaiAfter completing his graduation, he meets Eesha again in his cousin's sister Divya's boutique. He gives her a fifty percent offer on her purchase, and she asks him where he completed his schooling, as she thinks she might have met him somewhere, so he replies that he has studied at SVB school. After knowing he was her schoolmate, she introduced him to Gayathri. Gayathri knows him already as he was a friend of SS Karthik in school days, so Gayathri tells Eesha that SS Karthik is a rogue, so he might not have completed his college and he might have arrears. At that moment, Aravinth tells them that SS Karthik is now studying cardiology. So Gayathri gets SS's phone number, and Eesha gets Aravinth's phone number. Later, he helps Eesha's sister Preethi choose a dress for a competition with the help of Divya, which made her win the competition, so Preethi arranges a treat as she promised. After that, Eesha and Aravinth meet each other, and they become closer eventually. Eesha invites Aravinth to her house and introduces her parents to him. She tells him that SS and Gayathri are going to meet today. Gayathri gets to know that SS is not a cardiology student because he can't save a man who was unconscious. After knowing that SS is pretending to be a cardiologist, Eesha slaps him in the face. Later, SS asks Saba to break up with Eesha, so Saba records a video saying it's over between them because she slapped his friend. The next day, he happens to see her in a saree, and he gets mesmerised by her. He doesn't want to end his friendship with her. SS gets angry that he didn't break his relationship with her, and seeing Saba's phone in her hand, he thinks that she may have seen that video of Saba telling her to break up, so he tells Saba that she has seen that video. She didn't see any video, as she didn't know the password for the phone. Out of curiosity, she asked what the video was. Saba tells her about his crush on her since school days. She reveals that he should have proposed to her in school because now she has a boyfriend. After hearing these things, everyone in the police Jeep gets disappointed and asks Saba to tell them what happened next. He starts to tell them that after that incident, he joined an MBA college, and there he met Megha and how they got closer and how they became lovers. After hearing the last one, all of them got happy because Saba finally got a happy ending in his love journey. The police jeep stops, and some goons try to attack the sub-inspector, but Saba saves him. The sub-inspector thanks Saba not for saving him from those goons but for making him understand what love is. He says that in college he has five friends, two of whom are committed to the rest of the two, so the friends suggested that he fall in love with the remaining one, Deepthi. So he is going to break up with her as things are not working between them. As told, sub-inspectors broke up with Deepthi.",C. S.
